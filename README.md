# ModernSP.NPM.CliAndApi
A Node Package Manager (NPM) command line interface (CLI) that ensures all ModernSP dependencies are updated and present.

- When run, ensures all dependent npm global packages and local packages are upgraded to newest supported versions recommended by the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview) and ModernSP.
- Takes the burden off the developer for ensuring their npm dependencies are up to date!
- Works even if the internet or npm registry is blocked!
